          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
          <p>Interviewing users supplies an accumulation of different perspectives and ideas.<br>
            Questioning every feature and how a user interacts with the product<br>
            provides valuable insight on elements that have been overlooked<br>
            or features that are used differently than intended.<br>
            What worked and what needs improvement?</p>

          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>Exploration on what design language or features work or do not work.<br>
            Investigating products that offer a similar service as yours<br>
            provides a comprehenisive overview of the difference between<br>
            a product that succeeds and does not.</p>

          <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
          <p>Analysis of the importance of certain functionalities.<br>
            Using the information gathered from the competitor analysis,<br>
            I was able to compose a list of functionalities<br>
            I wanted to feature on my website.</p>

          <h3>Feature Priortization</h3>
          <p>Prioritized features that I found to be essential in the final product.<br>
            Finalizing this list drives the design of the interface of the final product,<br>
            providing an overview of what will be included.</p>

        <h1>User Testing</h1>
        <div>
          <h3>User Stories</h3>
          <p>Similar to user interviews, user stories provide a medium to further<br>
            understand and think about how a user would interact with your product.<br>
            The stories revolve around the key features of your product.</p>

          <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
          <p>The idea of a walkthrough is to further understand the thought process<br>
            behind every action a user takes while interacting with your product.<br>
            It is important to realize and grasp the reasons behind each decision<br>
            made by the user in order to deliver a better experience.<br>
            It is integral, however, to frame such a walkthrough without<br>
            placing any biases or tampering the user's reasoning.</p>

          <h3>User Test</h3>
          <p>Conducted two tests to determine how a user would interact<br>
            with the landing section of my website and the discover section.<br>
            I wanted to understand what the user would be more inclined to do when given certain tasks.<br>
            Creating the tests without providing the hover functionality made it hard to gain definitive results.</p>
